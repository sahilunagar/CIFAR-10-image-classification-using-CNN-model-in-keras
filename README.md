# CIFAR-10-image-classification-using-CNN-model-in-keras

This is a Python code for CIFAR-10 image classification model.
Dataset imported from keras datasets.
I Used 2 Convolutional layers wiht Relu activation followed by Maxppoling layer and Dropout regularization,
1 Dense layer with 512 units with Relu activation followed by 10 units Dense layer with Softmax activation (as there are 10 classes).

Then I saved the model in json file.
I plotted graphs of accuracy and loss of training data to observe the training.
